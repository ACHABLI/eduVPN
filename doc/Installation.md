# Installation and updating of eduVPN Client for Windows


## Setup
Download and run the EXE installer. Binaries are published [here](https://github.com/Amebis/eduVPN/releases).

## Update
A self-updating feature has been introduced beginning with version 1.0.11. You should be prompted to update when a new version is available on client startup.

To update manually, perform the following steps:
1. Exit eduVPN client if running.
2. Perform setup. No need to uninstall the previous version first.
